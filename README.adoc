= OpenShift Days - Ops Track Workshop

Showroom content for the OpenShift Days Ops Track workshop, covering Day 2 operations for OpenShift administrators.

== Workshop Overview

A comprehensive modular workshop for OpenShift administrators using CNV-based infrastructure with Hosted Control Planes for multi-cluster scenarios.

=== Available Modules

* *Platform Foundation* - OpenShift concepts, installation verification, application management
* *Networking* - Ingress, load balancing, network security
* *Day 2 Operations* - Debugging, troubleshooting, backup/restore (OADP), OpenShift Lightspeed
* *Workloads & Architecture* - Virtualization, ACM multi-cluster management, Hosted Control Planes
* *Security* - Secrets, certificates, Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)

== Module Selection

Modules are selectable at catalog order time. The navigation dynamically shows/hides content based on which modules are enabled.

Catalog parameters (`module_enable_*`) control both:

* Which operators/workloads get deployed
* Which content appears in the workshop navigation

See link:content/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc[nav.adoc] for the conditional navigation logic using `ifeval`.
