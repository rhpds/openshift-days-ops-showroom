== Module Overview

**Duration:** 30 minutes +
**Format:** Hands-on backup and restore operations +
**Audience:** Platform Engineers, Operations Teams, Disaster Recovery Specialists

**Narrative Context:**

Data protection is critical for production OpenShift clusters. In this module, you'll use the **OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP)** to backup and restore applications.

OADP is based on Velero and provides:

* Application-consistent backups
* Scheduled backup policies
* Cross-cluster restore capabilities
* Integration with S3-compatible storage

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Understand OADP architecture and components
* Configure backup storage locations
* Create application backups
* Restore applications from backups
* Implement backup schedules

== Prerequisites

The OADP Operator has been pre-installed in your cluster.

Verify the installation:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get csv -n openshift-adp | grep oadp
----

You should see the OADP operator with `Succeeded` status.
