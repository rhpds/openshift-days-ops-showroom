= OpenShift Days - Operations Track

== Why This Workshop Exists

Running Kubernetes in production is hard. Running it well — with enterprise authentication, automated backup, fleet management, and security compliance — is where most teams struggle.

OpenShift closes that gap. It takes upstream Kubernetes and adds the operational tooling that platform teams actually need: integrated monitoring, automated upgrades, built-in security policies, multi-cluster management, and developer self-service — all supported by Red Hat.

This workshop puts you in the driver's seat of a live OpenShift cluster so you can see how these capabilities work in practice, not just in slides.

== What You'll Do

Every module is hands-on. You'll deploy real applications, configure real security policies, break things on purpose and fix them, and explore the tools that make Day 2 operations manageable at scale.

This workshop is modular — your session may not include every topic below. The modules available to you are shown in the navigation on the left. The full catalog includes:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Area |What you'll explore

|**Platform Fundamentals**
|What makes OpenShift different from upstream Kubernetes — integrated monitoring, routing, operators, automated upgrades, and why it matters for your operations team

|**Application Operations**
|Deploy, expose, scale, and manage workloads. Configure ingress, TLS termination, load balancing, and network security policies

|**Identity & Access**
|Plug OpenShift into your existing identity infrastructure — LDAP, OIDC, group sync, RBAC. See how enterprise authentication replaces temporary admin accounts

|**Day 2 Operations**
|The work that starts after the cluster is running — observability with Prometheus and Loki, backup and restore with OADP, performance tuning with autoscalers

|**Advanced Capabilities**
|Virtualization (run VMs alongside containers), Hosted Control Planes (provision clusters in minutes), multi-cluster fleet management with ACM, security scanning with ACS, and AI-assisted operations with Lightspeed

|**Developer Productivity**
|Red Hat Developer Hub — how ops teams enable developer self-service with golden paths, software catalogs, and standardised templates
|===

Each module is standalone. Your environment has been configured with a specific set of modules — only the ones shown in the navigation on the left are available in this session.

== Your Environment

You have full cluster admin access to a production-grade OpenShift cluster:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Cluster |OpenShift 4.x with 3 control plane + 2+ worker nodes
|Access |Cluster admin privileges (full control)
|Terminal |Use the terminal tab on the right to run commands
|Console |Use the web console tab to explore the GUI
|===

== Verify Access

Confirm you're connected:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc whoami
----

You should see your service account or admin user.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes
----

You should see your control plane and worker nodes in `Ready` status.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get clusterversion
----

This confirms your cluster version and update channel.

== Ready?

Select the first module from the navigation on the left and let's get into it.
